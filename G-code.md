BealgeG G-Code interpretation
-----------------------------

##Syntax

G-Code is essentially a pair of 'letters' and 'numbers' that tell the machine
what to do. It is well described [somewhere else][Intro GCode], so this is only a
quick overview.
G-Codes are typically organized in lines. These are typical commands:

    G1 X10 Y20 ; move to X-coordinate 10 and Y=20
    G1X0Y8     ; no need for spaces between pairs - but readability sucks.
    G1 X10 (small move) Y200 (big move) ; comments can be in-line with parenthesis
    G1 X10 Y100 G1 X0 Y0  ; multiple commands can be in one line.

`G1` means: move in a coordinated move, i.e. the axis move in a way that the
final move resembles a straight line in the N-dimensional space they are in.
Comments can be at the end of line and start with a semicolon.

There can be comments _between_ pairs with parenthesis. This is not supported
by every G-Code interpreter, but BeagleG does:

    G1(coordinated move) X10(to this position)

## Supported commands

Supported commands are currently added on a need-to-have basis. They are a subset
of G-Codes found documented in [LinuxCNC] and [RepRap Wiki].

The following commands are supported. A place-holder of `[coordinates]` means
a combination of axis coordinates (such as `X10 Y20`) and an optional feedrate
(`F1000`).
Current set of supported axis-letters is X, Y, Z, E, A, B, C, U, V, W (the
`--axis-mapping` flag decides which make it to motors).

Line numbers `Nxx` and checksums `*xx` are parsed, but discarded and ignored
for now.

### M Codes dealt with by gcode-machine-control
The standard M-Code are directly handled by the G-code parser and result
in parametrized callbacks. Other not quite standard G-codes are handled in
[gcode-machine-control](./gcode-machine-control.c) when receiving
the `unprocessed()` callback (see API below):

### Feedrate in Euclidian space
The axes X, Y, and Z are dealt with specially by `gcode-machine-control`: they are
understood as representing coordinates in an Euclidian space (not entirely
unwarranted :) ) and thus applies a feedrate in a way that the resulting
path sees the given speed in space, not each individual axis:

    G28 G1 X100      F100  ; moves X with feedrate 100mm/min
    G28 G1 X100 Y100 F100  ; moves X and Y with feedrate 100/sqrt(2) ~ 70.7mm/min

## API
G-code parsing as provided by [the G-Code parse API](./gcode-parser.h) receives
G-code from a file-descriptor (via the `int gcodep_parse_stream()` function)
and calls parametrized parse-callbacks representing slightly more higher-level commands.

The coordinates passed to callbacks are _always_ pre-converted to machine-absolute and
metric to make implementation of the callback receivers easy.
The codes `G20`/`G21`/`G70`/`G71` and `G90`/`G91`/`G92` as well as
`M82`, `M83` are handled internally to always output absolute, metric coordinates.

Currently, the GCode parser also implements `G2` and `G3` and emits line-segments with
`coordinated_move()` callbacks (this should probably move outside the parser).

Commands that are not recognized are passed on to the `unprocessed()` callback
for the user to handle (see description in API).
